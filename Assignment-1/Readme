Implementation :
	Insert: We just split the node at the middle
	Find: We searched the key , if we get key=node key then we searched to its left if we find something then we just returned that address
unless we searched to the right of the node.
	Modifications : we kept nextaddress in treenode and modified the loadnode and store node
