The attachement contains 3 files
1)PrefixMatch.java performs only predicting the words with given prefix
2)NextWord.java performs along with predicting the words with given prefix,
it also top 3 preceding words for the given word. format of output is 
accordance with the format mentioned in the problem
3)Combiner.java it performs same fuction which is done by Nextword but
it uses combiner which is useful to reduce no.of read and write sectors.

Project Details:-
	1) PrefixMatch.java for every word greater than 3, we have mapped the 
all the prefix of the word to word given. Then reduced according to find
the 3 word which gives the  most prior probability of picking of the word 
with the given prefix
	2) NextWord.java, In addition to above we have mapped the word to its
next word so that we can find the 3 words which gives the most prior prob-
ability of picking preceding word given the current word
	3) Combiner.java, The combine perfors the same function of Nextword
but to the smaller inputs given by mapping function and reducer integrates
the output given by combiner to form output to whole data.

Acknowledgments:-
	Since nothing has mentioned about the ordering of words in the case of
tie. We have followed our own convention.
